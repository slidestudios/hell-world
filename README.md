Hi, I am new to coding. I am working through the IOS tracks on teamtreehouse. My aim is to become an IOS developer however I am still working my through some intermediate concepts. While doing the course I would like to explore Github and StackOverflow to gain a deeper understanding of how a developer works and what tools are at my disposal once I am up to speed! Any and all advice welcome!
